# Material UI / React Weather App

I wanted to create a weather app in order to practice my React skills and practice MUI

## OpenWeatherMap API

Since I am using a free API key, I utilize the _Current Weather Data_ API call and the _One Call_ API.

The _One Call_ API call provides current weather and forecast data, but it does not provide a location name and requires longitude and latitude coordinates for the query. In order to get location name and coordinates, I utilize the _Current Weather_ call.

[Current Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)

[One Call](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
